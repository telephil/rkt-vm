This file is used to keep track of bugs, improvements and general roadmap

* Bugs

** TODO Parser fails when no newline at end of file
   - Note taken on [2012-09-30 dim. 17:15] \\
     The parser might have to be rewritten completely as it complains after a reduction conflict
     Also I could not get it to understand arg-less instruction without a hack that force the last line to have a newline

** DONE Labels are encoded as NOP instructions in assembly output

** DONE Fix label address translation [100%]
   - Note taken on [2012-09-30 dim. 15:57] \\
     The assembler convert labels to address which is the line number in the parsed instruction vector.
     This will not work when reading program from memory as there are no lines there !!!
*** DONE Fix in assembler
*** DONE Review program loader

** DONE vmas output file are empty

* Improvements

** TODO Reduced opcode encoding size

** TODO Better error handling [0%]
*** TODO Parser errors
*** TODO Assembler errors
*** TODO Loader errors


* Roadmap

** TODO Binary execution [25%]
*** DONE Load program in memory
*** TODO Unload program from memory
    - Note taken on [2012-09-30 dim. 15:57] \\
      Should the whole memory be reset or do we consider that another program might also be loaded ?
*** TODO Instruction execution
    - Note taken on [2012-09-30 dim. 22:59] \\
      Partly implemented
*** TODO Stack definition and implemetation [0%]
**** TODO Definition
**** TODO Implementation

** TODO Debugger [0%]
*** TODO Create CLI parser
*** TODO Implement special debugging commands [0%]
**** TODO Registers inspection
**** TODO Memory inspection
