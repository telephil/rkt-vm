* rkt-vm: A useless Virtual Machine developed using Racket

rkt-vm is a simple Virtual Machine build using Racket.

It provides:
- an assembly to bytecode compiler, 
- a virtual machine able to load and execute bytecode,
- a debugger (not yet)

All of the code is developed using racket (only v5.3 has been tested)

I have various things I have in mind that will be implemented soon or later.
You can find a description of theses ideas in the todo.org file.
